# screen2html
This tool converts text that contains ANSI escape sequences for coloring or
formatting text (bold, underline, italics) to HTML, trying to preserve the
original terminal colors as closely as possible. One use case is to record a
screen session to a screen logfile and convert this to HTML (where you'd
otherwise make a non-copy/pastable screenshot if you wanted to preserve the
original colors). You can view an example here:
[https://johndoe31415.github.io/screen2html/](https://johndoe31415.github.io/screen2html/)
To use screen2html, you first need to use the log recording mechanism of
screen. This is achieved either by hitting "Ctrl-A H" during a running screen
session or by invoking screen with the "-L" argument, such as:

```
$ screen -L mylog.txt
```

Note that old versions of screen do not support setting the filename with the
"-L" option (my version 4.05.00 of 2016-12-10 does) -- these versions will
create a ```screenlog.*``` file instead.

Afterwards, you can run your logfile by screen2html, which will parse the
contained ANSI escape sequences and produce HTML that honors them. For example:

```
$ ./screen2html --complete-html --css-verbatim --css-filename example/terminal-tango.css screenlog.0 >screen.html
```

The help-page should be self-explanatory:

```
usage: screen2html [-h] [--complete-html] [--css-filename filename]
                   [--css-verbatim] [-c class]
                   filename

positional arguments:
  filename              Screen logfile that should be converted to HTML.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --complete-html       Generate a complete HTML file that can be directly
                        rendered in the browser.
  --css-filename filename
                        When generating a complete HTML file, specifies the
                        filename of the CSS to include. Defaults to terminal-
                        tango.css.
  --css-verbatim        When generating a complete HTML file, include the
                        specified CSS file verbatim, i.e., inside the HTML via
                        <style>, instead of by a <link> reference.
  -c class, --classname class
                        CSS class to use in HTML for terminal <pre>. Defaults
                        to xterm.
```


# CSS
You can specify a palette file in simple INI format, as seen in palette.ini.
Four standard palettes are already available and have been ripped from the
mate-terminal source code (using the "parse_mate_terminal" tool): tango, linux,
xterm and rxvt. First, either edit the palette INI file to your wishes, then
generate a CSS by running

```
$ ./mkcss -s mycolscheme >my_terminal.css
```

A help page is available and should, again, be self-explanatory:

```
usage: mkcss [-h] [-p configfile] [-s name] [-c class] [-b index] [-f index]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p configfile, --palette configfile
                        Specifies the palette file that is read in. Defaults
                        to palette.ini.
  -s name, --scheme name
                        Color scheme to pick from palette file. Defaults to
                        tango.
  -c class, --classname class
                        HTML class name that will be used in CSS. Defaults to
                        xterm.
  -b index, --bgcolor index
                        Background color index that is assumed as default.
                        Defaults to 0 (black).
  -f index, --fgcolor index
                        Foreground color index that is assumed as default.
                        Defaults to 7 (white).
```
